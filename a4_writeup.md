# Assignment 4 - Writeup

In assignment 4 we created a basic tic tac toe game so that we could learn object oriented programming. Respond to the following questions.

## Reflection Questions

1. What was the most difficult part to tic-tac-toe?

For me the most difficult part was to check to see if someone has one. The main reason is because the grid was a line so figuring out how to check if sooren won diagnal or down for me was confusing

2. Explain how you would add a computer player to the game.

Make it so after a player inputs their x or O the code will fill in the next move and then ask for the players move and so on and so on until the game ends

3. If you add a computer player, explain (doesn't have to be super technical) how you might get the computer player to play the best move every time. *Note - I am not grading this for a correct answer, I just want to know your thoughts on how you might accomplish it.

A very annoying way to do it would be a lot of if stamtnets so like if player playes it top right then its would play best move to coutner top right then if they played middle right after that it would chose the best move given that.
 an ex would be like
 if players placed top right
    place O middlle

if player placed middle and top right
    place middle or if taken place bottom right

and so on for every move
